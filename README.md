# Insurance_Data_Analysis_using_ML_Techniques


This project focuses on assessing the risk factor in the insurance industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the risk associated with life insurance applications based on the given dataset. The project uses the Prudential Life Insurance Assessment dataset, which can be found on Kaggle.

The project is implemented using four different machine learning techniques, aiming to compare their performances and evaluate their results on the test dataset. The output variable in the dataset is an ordinal variable, which requires treating the problem either as a regression problem or converting it to a set of binary classification problems. To reduce dimensionality, appropriate data preparation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques are applied.

Throughout the project, no code is directly copied from existing solutions on Kaggle. However, Kaggle and other resources may be consulted for guidance and reference.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into risk assessment in the insurance industry and showcases the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in addressing this problem. The GitHub repository will contain the necessary code, documentation, and presentation materials for a comprehensive understanding of the project.
